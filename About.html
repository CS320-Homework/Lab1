            <p>
                &nbsp When I'm not programming some of my hobbies include browsing Youtube, exercising, and playing video games. Nowadays,
                programming has been slipping into my hobbies since I will need to continue to improve my problem solving
                skills as well as learn new languages. Since technology is constantly progressing, programmers must also
                continue improving upon their skills.

                &nbsp Another interest of mine is my love more music, more specifically metal music. Throughout my childhood my dad would
                always be playing songs from Metallica, ACDC, Iron Maiden and other hard rock/metal bands. Eventually, in
                my teenager years my friend introduced me to heavier bands like Children of Bodom and Arch Enemy. Finally,
                around my high school years I finally went to my first concert. The band was DragonForce and the venue was
                The Wiltern. I couldn't believe how loud the music was. You would literally feel the drum pedal vibrate through
                you with every hit. Ever since then I've been going to concerts and I would say I've seen 90% of my favorite
                bands.

                &nbsp Something interesting about myself(I think) is in High School I ran in the Cross Country team and I came in last place
                in my first race. My high school self thought it was a good idea to jump into cross country without attending
                the (optional)summer practices. Unfortunately, one month is not enough time to prepare a novice for a three
                mile race. Sometimes you have to learn things the hard way and what a exhausting lesson I learned. While
                not as impressive as getting 1st place I would say it is just as interesting. If there is a message to be
                learned from this story it's that(no matter how cliche is sounds) it doesn't matter how long you take as
                long as you finish.
